1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you are effectively creating a git repository in the current directory. We need to initialize a
repository in order to begin tracking file changes and commits.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the intermediary zone for files to be tracked in the git repository. The staging area is used to set up 
files from the working directory to be tracked in the repository.
